        Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
        hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
        'Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday
        things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in
        the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this
        morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little
        different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in
        the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began
        thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
        as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
        them.

        "I'm sure I'm not Ada," she said, "for her hair goes in such
        long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm
        sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
        oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,
        and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the
        things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,
        and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!
        I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the
        Multiplication Table doesn't signify:...

    This fragment from the book is funny. But if we look at Alice's Multiplication Table with various numbers bases,
    then we can see the interesting regularity:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 X 5 = 12 (20 in base 18)</li>
    <li>4 X 6 = 13 (24 in base 21)</li>
    <li>4 X 7 = 14 (28 in base 24)</li>
    <li>4 X 8 = 15 (32 in base 27)</li>
    <li>4 X 9 = 16 (36 in base 30)</li>
    <li>4 X 10 = 17 (40 in base 33)</li>
    <li>4 X 11 = 18 (44 in base 36)</li>
    <li>4 X 12 = 19 (48 in base 39)</li>
    <li>4 X 13 = 20 (<strong>52 in base 26</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    As we can see, before we had gotten <strong>20</strong> that table had the regularity
    (the base increased by 3 for each step).
    So Alice was right when she said "I shall never get to twenty at that rate!".
</p>

<p>
    This way we can make various Multiplication Tables.
    We will give you the first and the second statements.
    You should continue that regularity until it breaks and return the first "result" which breaks this sequence
    (for first example is 20).
</p>
<p>
    Let's look one example. The input data is two strings -- "5 X 3 = 11" and "5 X 4 = 12".
</p>
<ul>
    <li>5 X 3 = 11 (15 in base 14)</li>
    <li>5 X 4 = 12 (20 in base 18)</li>
    <li>So we can see the regularity -- the base increases at 4.</li>
    <li>Let's continue it.</li>
    <li>5 X 5 = 13 (25 in base 22)</li>
    <li>5 X 6 = 14 (30 in base 26)</li>
    <li>5 X 7 = 15 (35 in base 30)</li>
    <li>5 X 8 = 16 (40 in base 34)</li>
    <li>5 X 9 = 17 (45 in base 38)</li>
    <li>5 X 10 = 18 (50 in base 42)</li>
    <li>5 X 11 = 19 (55 in base 46)</li>
    <li>5 X 12 = 20 (60 in base 30)</li>
</ul>
